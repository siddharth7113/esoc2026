In ESoC 2025, the `pyaptamer` package was developed through a collaboration between ecoSPECS and the German Center for Open Source AI to support the easy use of AI-based in silico aptamer generation.

## Application Prerequisites

These warm-up projects are intended to help applicants become familiar with the `pyaptamer` library. To apply for one of the European Summer of Code 2026 full projects, applicants should first gain familiarity with the library and open at least one substantial pull request, either fixing a bug or contributing a meaningful feature enhancement. The pull request does not need to be merged by the time the application is reviewed.

Applicants are also encouraged to actively use the library and identify bugs or usability issues that may have been missed by contributors. We expect potential applicants to communicate before taking on issues and opening pull requests. For simpler issues, a brief note is sufficient; for more complex ones, we expect a more detailed implementation plan.

The use of AI is permitted. However, relying on automated AI agents, or opening multiple pull requests or issues without verifying their output, may negatively affect an application.

## Full 2026 Projects

### Adding the AptaDiff Algorithm

Currently, the suite includes two algorithms, and we would like to expand the algorithmic coverage of the `pyaptamer` repository. This project involves adapting the [AptaDiff](https://github.com/wz-create/AptaDiff) algorithm from scratch to follow the scikit-learn-style API and the existing public API conventions of `pyaptamer`, together with appropriate test coverage.

Goals:

* develop the `pyaptamer.aptadiff` API and integrate it with the current `MoleculeLoader` data loader
* write tests for the implementation
* create a notebook demonstrating the public API on existing and new datasets

**Expected Time**: 300 hours<br>
**Difficulty Rating**: Hard<br>
**Required Skills**: Python, familiarity with deep learning, PyTorch, Lightning, and scikit-learn<br>

### Adding the DeepAptamer Algorithm

We would also like to expand the algorithmic coverage of the `pyaptamer` repository by adapting [DeepAptamer](https://github.com/TMBJ-lab/DeepAptamer) to follow the scikit-learn-style API and the current public API conventions, together with tests.

**Expected Time**: 250 hours<br>
**Difficulty Rating**: Hard<br>
**Required Skills**: Python, familiarity with deep learning, PyTorch, Lightning, and scikit-learn<br>
